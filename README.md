    <Title> Horiseon SSS, Inc. Project
    
    This README.md is for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. This marketing agency provides clients exceptional social media marketing, search engine optimization, and online reputation management.
    
    My motivation for this project was the awesome reputation this company upholds.
    
    I built this project to showcase Horiseon Social Solutions and other servies they offer. 
  
    This project solves the problem of Horiseon Social Solution Services once not having an online presence. 
    
    Throughout this project, I learned more about HTML, CSS, and the importance of accessible alt attributes.
